## TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE
### IQSpatial  
New York, NY  
**Python Machine Learning Engineer Intern**  
June 2023 – Present  

- Developed a RAG-based LLM application that enables users to extract and organize financial data from text documents using LangChain and OpenAI API, reducing business intelligence research time by 85%
- Built an LLM output validation system using NLTK, integrated topic modeling and keyword extraction
- Engineered a YOLO-driven machine-learning pipeline that allows users to detect objects in satellite imagery, extract the geospatial coordinates of objects with GDAL, and record object data simultaneously
- Deployed the ML pipeline in a hurricane disaster relief response and detected blue tarps with 84% accuracy 
- Created an object detection website that allows users to run YOLO on their images. Used CSS/JavaScript for frontend interaction and image uploading while utilizing Python to integrate the YOLO framework

### Ursa Space Systems  
Ithaca, NY  
**NASA New York Space Grant - Data Science Intern**  
May 2022 – August 2022  

- Reduced geospatial data preprocessing time by 90% by developing a Python command line prompt tool that enabled the automated mass conversion of 1000+ CSV files from AWS into a GEOJSON format. Verified the tool’s functionality and calculations in QGIS by overlaying the output with SAR satellite imagery
- Procured machine learning model performance insights by retraining a classification model over newly converted and existing data within EC2, discovered that K-Fold Cross Validation could improve accuracy

### Gamco Corporation  
Queens, NY  
**Computer Systems Analyst**  
January 2022 – April 2022  

- Reduced inventory counting time from two months to two weeks by building an Excel-based digital solution. Collaborated with inventory managers and shop floor workers to customize the tool to their needs
- Screened software engineers and sales representatives to determine the best Enterprise Resource Planning company from which to make a $250,000 cloud-based software purchase based on Gamco’s requirements
